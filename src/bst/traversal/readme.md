Given a binary search tree (BST), show the order of keys when performing pre-order traversal, in-order traversal, and post-order traversal?

Input Format

The first line contains the number of keys in the tree,

.

The second line contains the keys in the order at which they are inserted in the binary search tree.

Constraints

All keys are integers in the range to

All inserted keys are guaranteed to be unique

Output Format

Three lines, as follows:

The first line contains the keys in pre-order traversal

The second line contains the keys in in-order traversal

The third line contains the keys in post-order traversal
